# Atomic Structure and Properties
## Concepts  
1. Moles and Molar Mass
 - 6.02x10^-23 atoms/mole
 - 
2. Mass Spec of Elements
 - Determines isotopes
 - Relative abundances weighted averages
 - ![Mass Spec Example Result](./massSpec.png)
 - Highest(most common isotope) peak = base peak 
 - z=-1 vaporized ions passed thru magnet, move more = lighter 

3. Classification of matter
 - Mixture/Pure Substance(can it be separated)
   - Mixture: Homogeneous(solution) if uniform composition, heterogeneous if not
     - Purity: $\frac{mass\ wanted\ substance}{mass\ total\ sample}$
   - Pure Sub: Compound if can be decomposed, Element if can't be
 - Hydrates(compounds)$Na_2CO_3\cdot H_2O$ - Water in ionic lattice 
 - Chemical Formula gives ratio of atoms present in a substance(of moles & mass), Empirical is lowest ratio 
 - **Law of definite proportions** - (Mass and Mole ratio constant)
4. Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration 
 - **Coulomb's law** - $F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$
 - More non-valence e- = more shielding of nuclear charge on valence e-
 - Pauli Exclusion(spin/addresses), Aufbau(lowest orbitals first), Hund(spread out before 2 in any orbital) 
5. Photoelectron Spectroscopy 
 - Gaseous sample hit w/ UV/X-ray, nrg it takes to remove e- shows nrg lvl 
 - ![PES Spectrum Example](./peSpec.png)
 - Each peak is subshell, height is relative #e-, nrg inc w/ aufbau shortcut
6. Periodic Trends 
  - Use Shielding and Radius to justify all changes(and shielding to justify radius)
    - Radius justify by nrg lvl/shell(1-7), shielding 
    - Electron-electron repulsion also pushes out, but countered strongly within row by inc proton pull
 - Ionization Nrg - Closer = Greater = Harder to pull e- away 
 - Electronegativity - atom attracting e- to itself 
 - Electron affinity - nrg for addition of atom(how much it wants an electron)(opp ionization nrg)
 - Metals/Metalloids/Nonmetals ![Periodic Table w/ Classificaitons](./pdTblwClass.png)
7. Valence e- and Ionic Compounds 
 - Balance to be neutral 
 - Cation decreases radius(possible lose shell, dec e-&e- repulsion)
 - Elements in the same groups tend to form similar compounds bc same ion charges 
## Problems 

# Molecular and Ionic Compound Structure and Properties 
1. Types of Chemical Bonds 
 - Ionic
   - Valence e- transferred(Metals+Nonmetals)(LARGE EN diff)
   - Lattice, hard to melt 
   - Soluble, conductive in water 
 - Covalent(shared e-, btw nonmetals, not conductive)
   - Polar 
     - e- shared unequally(higher EN in unequal places)
     - Diff ~.04-1.8
     - Soluble
   - NonPolar
   - Network 
     - 
 - Metallic
   - **Delocalized** Valence e-
   - Between metals only 
   - High melting, not soluble, conductive, malleable, ductile
   - Stronger if atoms can give more e-
