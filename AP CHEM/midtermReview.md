# Atomic Structure and Properties
## Concepts  
1. Moles and Molar Mass
 - 6.02x10^-23 atoms/mole
 - 
2. Mass Spec of Elements
 - Determines isotopes
 - Relative abundances weighted averages
 - ![Mass Spec Example Result](./massSpec.png)
 - Highest(most common isotope) peak = base peak 
 - z=-1 vaporized ions passed thru magnet, move more = lighter 

3. Classification of matter
 - Mixture/Pure Substance(can it be separated)
   - Mixture: Homogeneous(solution) if uniform composition, heterogeneous if not
     - Purity: $\frac{mass\ wanted\ substance}{mass\ total\ sample}$
   - Pure Sub: Compound if can be decomposed, Element if can't be
 - Hydrates(compounds)$Na_2CO_3\cdot H_2O$ - Water in ionic lattice 
 - Chemical Formula gives ratio of atoms present in a substance(of moles & mass), Empirical is lowest ratio 
 - **Law of definite proportions** - (Mass and Mole ratio constant)
4. Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration 
 - **Coulomb's law** - $F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$
 - More non-valence e- = more shielding of nuclear charge on valence e-
 - Pauli Exclusion(spin/addresses), Aufbau(lowest orbitals first), Hund(spread out before 2 in any orbital) 
5. Photoelectron Spectroscopy 
 - Gaseous sample hit w/ UV/X-ray, nrg it takes to remove e- shows nrg lvl 
 - ![PES Spectrum Example](./peSpec.png)
 - Each peak is subshell, height is relative #e-, nrg inc w/ aufbau shortcut
6. Periodic Trends 
  - Use Shielding and Radius to justify all changes(and shielding to justify radius)
    - Radius justify by nrg lvl/shell(1-7), shielding 
    - Electron-electron repulsion also pushes out, but countered strongly within row by inc proton pull
 - Ionization Nrg - Closer = Greater = Harder to pull e- away 
 - Electronegativity - atom attracting e- to itself 
 - Electron affinity - nrg for addition of atom(how much it wants an electron)(opp ionization nrg)
 - Metals/Metalloids/Nonmetals ![Periodic Table w/ Classificaitons](./pdTblwClass.png)
7. Valence e- and Ionic Compounds 
 - Balance to be neutral 
 - Cation decreases radius(possible lose shell, dec e-&e- repulsion)
 - Elements in the same groups tend to form similar compounds bc same ion charges 
## Problems 

# Molecular and Ionic Compound Structure and Properties 
1. Types of Chemical Bonds 
 - Ionic
   - Valence e- transferred(Metals+Nonmetals)(LARGE EN diff)
   - Lattice, hard to melt 
   - Soluble, conductive in water 
 - Covalent(shared e-, btw nonmetals, not conductive)
   - Polar 
     - e- shared unequally(higher EN in unequal places)
     - Diff ~.04-1.8
     - Soluble
   - NonPolar(all opp polar, < en diff)
   - Network 
     - Btw Identical atoms or very close EN 
     - Large lattices - High melting points, not soluble, very hard 
     - SiO4
 - Metallic
   - **Delocalized** Valence e-
   - Between metals only 
   - High melting, not soluble, conductive, malleable, ductile
   - Stronger if atoms can give more e- 
2. Intramolecular Force and Potential Energy 
 - Bond Strength - Coulombs law, larger q1q2 = larger electrostatic force, smaller dist(r) = larger electrostaticforce
 - Morse Potental diagrams(Potential nrg/bond strength vs Internuclear distance), balance
 - ![Morse Diagram Image](./MorseDiag.png)
3. Structure of Ionic Solids(lattices)
 - ions change size when entering 
 - Brittle bc snap out of place when +/+&-/- next to eachother
4. Structure of Metals and Alloys
 - Delocalized e- allow for properties(e- always fills spot next to p+)
 - Substitutional(intro new element of similar size)
 - Interstitial(intro smaller element)
 - Combination(both)
 - In general, harder atomic motion = less malleable, less ductile, etc 
5. Lewis Diagrams 
 - ionic - $2[Al]^{3+}3[O]^{2-}$(brackets and powers of things, neutral overall)
 - Covalent - shared rep w/ line, unboned as lone pair
 - ![Covalent Lewis](./CovalentLewis.png)
   - Count Valence e- w/ charge
   - ID central atom(lowest EN, begins formula, wants to form most # bonds), atch as many single bonds as possible
   - Complete octets w/ lone pairs
   - Add remaining valence to central atom 
   - Complete octet of central by coverting lone pairs to bonds(double counted as valence e-)
 - Exceptions to Octet: 1st Shell(2e-), Incomplete octets low EN(Be, B, Al(transition)), d orbital hybridization expand octet
 - Bond strength(#shared e- inc q in coulombs law, dec r)
6. Resonance and Formal Charge 
 - Resonance - Avg structures if mult correct, bond order = #bonds/#bonding locations(or logic)
 - Formal Charge = # Valence e- - # covalent bonds - #e- in lone pairs(counts all e- but single counts bonds)(octet rule double counts bonds so they balance out)
 - Most accurate lewis structure - Min formal charges, neg charges on mose EN atom,
7. VSEPR and Bond Hybridization 
 - VSEPR 
   - Electron dense areas(steric #) - Lone or bonded pairs of any order 
   - Shapes based on wanting to separate e-
   - ![VESPR CHART](./VESPR.png)
   - Polarity/Symmetry
 - Hybridization 
   - Mixing of atomix orbitals to max stability 
   - Requires nrg to excite e- from lower lvl  
   - Can get better/more stable orbitals w/ hybridization w/ more evenly distributed e-  
   - Same VSEPR Shapes just w/ number *orbitals* being combined ex: sp = linear 
   - Bonding = e- overlap, first in nuclear plane w/ sigma bonds btw hybridized sp orbitals, then w. p orbitals, take up space around molec bc off nuclear plane   
   - Always one sigma bond, following ones are pi
# Intramolecular Forces and Properties
1. Intermolecular Forces 
 - Columbs law btw 2+ molecs 
 - ion-dipole, dip-dip, Hbond, ion-induced dipole, dipole-induced dipole, LDFs
 - Stronger partial cherges = stronger IMFs
 - H-bonding needs very EN(O,F,N)
 - LDFs - **Polarizability** #e-, size, shape, *Bond types(pi bonding inc area e- are spread over)*
2. Properties of Solids 
 - Diff w/ ionic metallic, covalend, network covalent 
3. Solids, Liquids, and Gases
 - Phase changes + names, cooling = nrg released 
 - Constancy of volume and shape
4. Ideal Gas Law 
 - Assumptions of ideal gases - 1.small/hard/insig volume 2.fast, random, straight lines w/ constant speed 3.elastic collisions 4.no IMFs 5.nrg solely based on temp 
 - Pressure - P=Force(particle bounce)/Area(walls of container)
 - $PV = nRT$
 - Partial pressures law - total pressure = sum of each gasses's pressures 
 - Diffision/effusion(Graham's law, effusion rate $\propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}})$, applicaiotn of KM theory 
 - 
5. Kinetic Molecular Theory 
 - $KE = 1/2mv^2$, assumed to have insig potential nrg  
 - $KE\propto Kelvin temp$ 
 - Maxwell boltzmann curves of kinetic nrg averages w/ inc porportion beyond avg temp 
6. Deviation from Ideal Gas Law 
 - Break simplifications of ideal gasses - more IMFs
 - Most ideal at High temp, low pressure, high volume 
7. Solutions and Mixtures 
 - Solns - homogeneous mixtures of solute and solvent of any state of matter 
 - Molarity - Moles/L soln 
 - Dilutions $M_1V_1 = M_2V_2$
 - Steps to solvation - Dissolving(chunks), Dissociation(molec sep(ions)), Solvation(Stabilized by solvent interactions)
 - "Like disolves like"(dont say this say specific type)
 - Saturated - solvent dissolved max amnt of solute
 - Filtration - for solids and liquids, dosent work with solutions 
 - Distillation - burner, evap, etc, sep by boiling point
8. Representations of Solutions 
 - Rep w/ charges and such
9.  Separation of Solutions and Mixtures Chromatography 
 - Chromatography sep by polarity
   - Mobile phase, stationary phase
   - Paper+TLC, move up stationary phase(tlc fancier stationary)
   - Column chromatography(fancy, move down tube)
10. Solubility 
 - Unlimited solubility = miscibile, with very similar IMFs and polarity 
 - Unsaturated/Saturated/Supersaturated
 - Solubility rules(Na+, Li+, K, NO3, NH3) all soluble
11. Spectroscopy and the em Spectrum 
 - Microwaves - Rotate atoms in molec; Infared - Transition e- vibration lvls; UV/Vis - molec nrg lvls; X-rays&>> = Ionization
 - Infared vibration = periodic change of dipole, stronger absorb if stronger polarity 
12. Photoelectric Effect 
 - 1. Absorption - e- absorbs nrg, 2. Excitation - e- is excited, 3. Emission - e- returns, light released as nrg 
 - conserv. nrg, nrg of photon(quantized) as  $c=\lambda v$, $E=hv$
13. Beer-Lambert Law
 - Use light absorb to det. concentration of diff colored solns 
 - Use standard curve(w/ known concentrations), constant path length(cuvette measurement), substance 
 - $A = \epsilon bc$ - Absorbance, Molar absorptivity, path length, concentration 
 - 

# Chemical Reactions 
1. Introduction for reactions 
2. Net Ionic Equations 
 - Ions dissassoc(except insoluble or covalent)
 - Break into spectator ions and net ionic eq
3. Representations of Reactions 
 - w/ the cartoon things w/ charges and ratios and partial bonds etc
4. Physical and Chemical Changes 
 - Physical - No change identity of substance - IMFs - indicator: strength/durability/crystal form/texture
 - Chemical - Do change identity of substance - Changes in molec bonds - indicator: color/bubble/temp/odor/light/
5. Stoichiometry
 - STOICH!!! yay:)
 - Limiting reagent - find least number of moles+give nessecary answer 
 - percent yield = Actual yield/theoretical yield x100%
6. Introduction to Titration 
7. Types of Chemical Reactions
 - Synth, Decomp, Replace, Acid-base(form salt+water), RedOx  
8. Introduction to Acid-Base Reactions 
 - Arrhenius Theory - Acids dissociate into H+ ions in water, bases dissassoc OH-
 - Bronsted-Lowry - Acids donate protons, Bases can accept protons
 - Conj acid/base - same non-proton component on either side - strong acid->weak base
 - Polyprotic - multiple Hs, gets weaker after each dissassoc
 - Amphoteric - acts as acid and base(water)
 - Neutralization - form salt and water, react in equal amounts
9.  Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions 
 - Charge of element will change 
 - Can be single-replacement, synthesis, decomp, combustion
 - Double repl, Acid-base NOT REDOX
 - Key rules: unbonded elements+diatoms:0; ion:charge; Typically follow #valence; H:+1, except metal:-1; Oxygen: -2 except in peroxide:-1; polyatomions, last element is negative(others >0)
 - Balance e- too; half reactions; if acidic/basic conditions balance all, then O with H_2O, then H with H_2, if basic add hydroxide once recombine reactions 
 - 

# Kinetics 
1. Reaction Rates 
 - Rate = change in concentration per time
2. Introduction to Rate Law 
 - Typicaly reaction slows down over time, rate law is reaction rate over time  
 - Zero Order - Concentration no fx on rate, First Order - Concentration proportionally impact rate, 2nd order - change concentration squaredly impact rate
3. Concentration Changes Over Time
 - ![rate law graphs](./Ratelawgraphs.png)
 - $Rate = k[A]^x[B]^y...$
4. Elementary Reactions 
 - Slow/rate determining step - highest Ea, 
 - Can use coefficients as order of elementary steps 
 - Steady state approx(rate1F/1R)
5. Collision Model
 - Many many collisions, effective if have I. high enough energy, II. proper orientation 
 - Modifying these things changes reaction rate(Concentration, Temp, Physical State, Catalyst)
6. Reaction Energy Profile 
 - Potential nrg x Reaction progress w/ peaks(act. complexes), troughs(reaction intermediates), start+finish+E_a
7. Introduction to Reaction Mechanisms 
8. Reaction Mechanism and Rate Law 
9.  Stead-State Approximation 
10. Multistep Reaction Energy Profile 
11. Catalysis 
 - Decrease activation energy
 - Homogeneous - samephase 
 - Heterogeneous - diff phase 
 - Either bind covalently or with IMFs to reactants 
 - Arrhenius equation relates temp of reaction to molec collisions
