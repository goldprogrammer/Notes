# Atomic Structure and Properties
## Concepts  
1. Moles and Molar Mass
 - 6.02x10^-23 atoms/mole
 - 
2. Mass Spec of Elements
 - Determines isotopes
 - Relative abundances weighted averages
 - ![Mass Spec Example Result](./massSpec.png)
 - Highest(most common isotope) peak = base peak 
 - z=-1 vaporized ions passed thru magnet, move more = lighter 

3. Classification of matter
 - Mixture/Pure Substance(can it be separated)
   - Mixture: Homogeneous(solution) if uniform composition, heterogeneous if not
     - Purity: $\frac{mass\ wanted\ substance}{mass\ total\ sample}$
   - Pure Sub: Compound if can be decomposed, Element if can't be
 - Hydrates(compounds)$Na_2CO_3\cdot H_2O$ - Water in ionic lattice 
 - Chemical Formula gives ratio of atoms present in a substance(of moles & mass), Empirical is lowest ratio 
 - **Law of definite proportions** - (Mass and Mole ratio constant)
4. Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration 
 - **Coulomb's law** - $F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$
 - More non-valence e- = more shielding of nuclear charge on valence e-
 - Pauli Exclusion(spin/addresses), Aufbau(lowest orbitals first), Hund(spread out before 2 in any orbital) 
5. Photoelectron Spectroscopy 
 - Gaseous sample hit w/ UV/X-ray, nrg it takes to remove e- shows nrg lvl 
 - ![PES Spectrum Example](./peSpec.png)
 - Each peak is subshell, height is relative #e-, nrg inc w/ aufbau shortcut
6. Periodic Trends 
  - Use Shielding and Radius to justify all changes(and shielding to justify radius)
 - Ionization Nrg - Closer = Greater = Harder to pull e- away 
 - Metals/Metalloids/Nonmetals ![Periodic Table w/ Classificaitons](./pdTblwClass.png)
