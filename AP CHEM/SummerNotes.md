## Atomic Theory
### Pre-modern
 - Democritus = concept of atom(indivisible), plato and aristotle say is impossible
 - Atom concept reemerged in europe 17th C bc chemists started thinking abt elements
 - Dalton = Theory linking elements and atoms
 - Thompson = Plum pudding(cathode rays working proves that there are negative particles in atoms
 - Rutherford(Gold foil, sees some alpha particles bounce back when hit nucleus(proves positive nucleus))
 - Bohr(circular energy level orbits, used spectra) 
### Modern/Quantum model
 - Heisenburg uncertianty principle
   - No good explaination in book as to why other than waves?
   - $\ \Delta x * \Delta (mv) \ge {h}\over{4\pi}$
   - $\Delta x$ is uncertianty, is far too big for electrons, negligible for everyday
 - Shrodinger's wave equations
   - Equations dealing with wve and particle e- behavior
   - Treated e- like plucked guitar string, observed nodes of waves
   - Square of wave function ($\psi^2$) gives us statistical meaning of location of e-
   - Solutions yield orbitals
 - Quantum numbers(describe orbitals)
   - Principle quantum number(n)
   : positive integer, n increase, energy level increase, avg dist from nuc inc
   - Angular momentum quantum number(l)
   : s/0, p/1, d/2, f/3, etc. l is on \[0,n-1], there are n possibilities for l
   - Magnetic quantum number ($m_l$)
   : $m_l$ is integer on(-l, l), show orientation of orbital
   - in atoms with many electrons, increasing l(spdf) values increase energy
     - Orbitals with same energy(same subshell) are called degenerate orbitals
   - Magnetic spin number ($m_s$)
   : is either $+{1\over 2}$ or $-{1\over 2}$
   - Pauli exclusion principle says no 2 e- can have same $n, l, m_l, m_s$ numbers
     - Implies each orbital can have a max of 2 e- and they must have opposite spins
   - Hunds rule says that an orbital's energy is minimized when there are the max number of same-spin e-
     - So for carbon the unfilled 2p orbital both are same $+{1\over 2}$ or $-$
     - These e- have parallel spin
## Periodic table
### Trends
 - Radius inc down and left
   - I guess bc the s orbitals are large and the other orbitals bring everything closer??
   - Technically is bacause $Z_{eff}$(Effective *nuclear* charge) increases across a period, pulls harder
 - Ionic Radii
