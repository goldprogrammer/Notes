***
 - do 2 perry docs 
 - Rev of science thoughts
   - Sci. Method(way of thinking)
   - Disagreements with church 
   - Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Bacon, Descartes
   - Astronomy and Medicine are main changes 
   - CALCULSUSSSOIJASFIEYAYYAYAYAY
   - Coffee and Cafes 
 - Historical prospectives
   - Scientifically wrong views that show lead to modern science in progression 
   - Studing what it was like to think and be in that time period 
   - Copernicus views of both heliocentricism and Geocentricism wrong, but is trying, IS CATHOLIC BUT wants to make gods creation better understood
 - Massively diff views of universe, much less religiously motivates - earthairwindfire, keeps some religious elements(circles)

## Primary sources
### Galileo(Inquisition Reasoning)
- Defended Copernicus ideas vs weak arguments of protestant+catholics, shouldnt blindly follow scripture to explain natural world
- Realizes copernicus not entirely correct, but important part of the process
- Idea of nature uniformity
  - Telescope showed imperfections on heavanly objects(moon craters)
  - Telescope showed moons orbiting jupiter(orbits around things other than earth)
  - Argues for separation of church from science 
- Put under house arrest for ideas by inquisition
  - Take issue with ideas+teaching of ideas DONT DISPUTE SCIENCE
  - Felt any counter bible == slippery slope

### Newton(*Principa Mathematica*)
 - Laws of gravity destroy mideavel universe view, address all copernicus counters, etc 
 - Reinforced natural uniformity of copernicus(no division btw heavanly and earthly worlds)
 - ppl didnt like bc removed mystery from universe 
 - Beieves heavily in the ideas of expiremntal supremacy and that everything is made of the sum of its parts(sees a system understood by motion)
 - Uses ^ to justify natural uniformity and gravity etc 
 - Newton was a devout anglican, thought god created hyperorganized universe 
 - Excuses existance of god as must be true but cant be understood(WERIDDD)

### Pascal(seb)
 - Existentialism 
 - Compared belief in science to loss of morals helped by religion
 - PPL are imperfect, ideas made by ppl are bad, put faith in god
 - Science cant explain everything because infinity 
 - What is the purpose of living, etc 
 - Pascals dilemma(believes in god bc no consequences if dosent believe in god)
 - Frightened by infinity of time and space and why HE exists 
 - Pushes back on trend of only relying on science
 - Not promoting the church, promoting christianity to reconcile with his existentialism

### Bacon(treyton)
 - Bacon is a very delicious breakfast meet it is smoked on different kinds of har d wood, peppered bacon creates mreo tension 
 - Looked at things and came up with techniques
   - 'There are and can only be two ways of searching... begenning with general axioms, building up to more conclusions[deductive reasoning](IS WORSE THAN ->)deriving axioms from senses and patterns of response, is better but less tried'
 - 

### Descartes(Founder of modern philosophy)
 - Concepts inherent to mind, must be discovered
 - Intuitions, mind derives truth from intuiting necessities
 - Dosent accept anything taught to him(question everything and build)
 - Sees rational thought as the basis of everything("I think therefore I am") - only way he can prove he is existing 
 - Wants certianty granted by rational mind 
 - Pascal would say there are things beyond the rational mind(god, is insignifcant bc universe is so large)
 - Descartes trusted rational mind not senses because ithinkthereforeiam, because concepts exist before we think about them, imprinted in mind just have to become aware of them 
 - 

## Mideavel "Science"
 - Love aristotle bc is so logical and can be bent to christian stuff
 - Greek perceptions of supernatural fit with christian stuff 
 - Becomes that you have to fit all new observations into aristotle/christian matrix 
 - Realm of man and realm of god 

## Non-Mideavel Science 
 - Galileo(discovers moons, makes fun of Geocentricism) and (tico brahey and kepler()) else try to PROVE Copernicus right
 - Find mostly accurate, not entirely(circles)
 - Retrogrades(apparant bkwds motion of planets explained very confusingly with epicycles)
   - Copernicus wonders why god would make so complex
   - Not trying to disprove church, just trying to make everything make more sense

### Medicine 
 - Traditional view is Galen; 2 types of blood, Four Humors(blood, yellow bile, phlegm, black bile)
 - Paracelsus(new): Chemical philosophy based on macro/micro view of universe(small things and big things in universe, use microscope) with similarities/chemical inbalances "like cures like", crystal stuff
   - Alchemy
 - Universality also applies to medicine 
 - Vesalius(new): Begenning of expiremental anatomy
   - Surgeons, rembrandt dr toupe disecting corpse 
   - Dissections disproved many parts of gales(heart as source of blood not liver)
   - Blood cicrulation work done by harvey
 - Similarity btw human and animal anatomy
   - Universality and stuff
 - Boyle(Gases), Atomic theory 
 - Antoine and Maris Lavoisier - Naming chemicals

## Methedology
 - Induction(getting pattern from data)(bacon promotes) and deduction(descartes+others)
 - Epiricism(based on expirence)(locke)
 - Descartes must understand a pattern to believe something/what he believes must fit patterns or he will modify patterns(didnt like to trust senses) 
 - Copernicus hermeticism, Kepler takes data from tyco brahe, forms ideas LOOKING FOR A SYSTEM
 - Still not entirely secular, still some mysticism/god, esp newton(system is orderly and rational, needs creator, somewhat pascal+copernicus)
 - Practical side to the science(even though we focus on thinkers, distinct focus on application) - thinky thinky changes filter down to being used by real ppl, also academies(Royal academy(bacon in england))
 - English bill of rights same time as locke how to gov and essay on human understanding

## Stages
 - First stage 15-1600s(astronomy and physics)(early on mechanical motion of movement) culminating with newtons then 17-1800s(mediciene and anato) and later
   - Limited at first by simple mechanical view of motion(macro and micro)
   - Locke transitions from later phase to enlightenment

## Women 
 - Largely nothing changes, reinforced by lack of being scientific when dealing with Women 
 - Fall back on existing ideas
 - Some that go against it(cavendish, look in speilvogel)


## Timeline of people 
Copernicus/Vesalius -> Kepler/Galileo -> Harvey/Descartes/Bacon -> Newton/Cavendish -> pascal
