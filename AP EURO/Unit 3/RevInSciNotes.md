## Background 
 - Middle ages had philosophers, had advanced thinking but were limited by theology+reliance on ancient ppl(aristotle and galen)
   - Splitting of the church, etc allows for ^ to change 

### Ancient Authors and Renaissance Artists
 - **Rennaisance was before SciRev, this is talking about renaissance**
 - Ability to read other greek texts(diff authors and diff works by same authors) reveals contradictions even in ancient times 
 - Renaissance Artists also contrib to science bc accurate renderings of nature and anatomy
 -
