***
## Background 
 - Middle ages had philosophers, had advanced thinking but were limited by theology+reliance on ancient ppl(aristotle and galen)
   - Splitting of the church, etc allows for ^ to change 

### Ancient Authors and Renaissance Artists
 - **Rennaisance was before SciRev, this is talking about renaissance**
 - Ability to read other greek texts(diff authors and diff works by same authors) reveals contradictions even in ancient times 
 - Renaissance Artists also contrib to science bc accurate renderings of nature and anatomy
   - Davinci machines/inventions 

### Technological Innovations and Mathematics 
 - Need for tech+knowledge bc exploration+ships+etc 
 - Often discovery of new things/inventions kept private as state secrets
 - Much advancement made by practical minded ppl outside of universities 
 - When shared, way more good stuff
   - Printing press was indirecty important
   - Telescope+microscope 
 - Increase in mathematical reasoning, can be applied to all disciplines(kepler, copernicus, galileo all think math is key to nature)

### Renaissance in Magic 
 - 'Magic' associated with intellectual elite across europe 
 - Became an essential part of alchemy and math 
   - Believed world was embodyment of divinity, humans extension of it 
   - Studied natural objects, perhaps stimulated sciRev 
   - This together is known as hermetecism
 - Hermeticism Studied by all the big ppl in the scirev 

## Toward a New Heaven: A Revolution in Astronomy 
 - Most advanced areas were areas most formerly dominated by greeks(Med+Astr) (aristotle and ptolomey and christian theology(not greek whatever))
 - Geocentrism, circles, earth, air, fire, water, earth imperfect(unlike heaveans)
   - Aristotles circles perfect and godly, orbs of light(ID 10 planets and fixed stars)
   - All fits with scripture too 
 - New astronomers wanted to find exact paths 
   - Tried to reckon opposing views w/ epicycles 

### Copernicus 
 - Studied math and astronomy in home krakow and in italy, then bacame aware of aincent views contradicting ptolomy/geocentrism 
 - 1506-1530 wrote On the revolutions of the HEavenly Spheres, didnt publish until shortly before death in 1543 
 - Relied on predecessors for data 
 - Got heliocentrism and moon around earth correct and spin of earth 
 - Not all that revolutionary(NPI)
   - Still included some epicycles, still overly complicated overall 
   - Kept circles 
 - Further effects 
   - Raised uncertianty abt human role in unvierse and gods location 
   - Protestant reformers hate this bc goes vs bible exact 
   - Catholic church didnt denounce until galileo+cop inc pop forces them to

### Brahe 
 - Danish nobleman, granted posession of island, built castle w/ astronomy stuff 
 - Provided 20yrs of detailed star data for kepler later on 
 - Enuf to reject Aristotle/Ptolomey, but unable to accept that the eart moved 
 - Took kepler as assistant in prague 

### Kepler 
 - Destined to be lutheran minister 
 - Influeced by Michael Mastlin(best german astronomer)
 - Line btw magic and science 
   - Kepler interested in hermetic magic(like theory unvierse built on geometric figures)
   - Motivated to study astronomy bc thought 'harmony' of human soul emulated by relationships btw planets 
 - Good at science and math, replaced barhe as imperial mathemacian
 - Got access to planet data, did keplers laws of planetary motion, just more evidence vs aristotle/ptolomey 
 - laws: 1.Not circles 2.planet speed >> when closer to sun 3. square of planet period of revolution propto cube of avg distnce from sun 
 - Ended circular idea, Opened to new ways of looking at it, new questions to be answered 

### Galileo 
 - Taught math at pisa and Padua(prestig. univ)
 - First euro to use telescope 
   - Saw craters on the moon 
   - Saw moons around other planets 
   - Saw phases of venus
   - Saw sunspots 
 - Universe composed of earthly-ish substance 
 - Popularized ideas(Actually OBSERVED INCORRECTNESS)
 - Made galileo famous, captured suspicion of catholics 

#### The inquisition 
 - *the starry messsenger* revealed galileo as heliocentric advocate, chruch no likey(focus on contrary to scripture/theology not contrary to reality)
 - Allowed to discuss copernicianism as mathematical concept not real thing 
 - Never really accepted this, published another work in italian for public in mocking style of aristotle views 
 - Inquisition again, Placed under house arrest for remaining 8 years of his life, studied mechanics and made significant contributions 

#### Galileo's motive struggles(motion not motivation)
 - Aristotle view 
   - Object in motion if and only if force being applied, heavier force = faster VELOCITY(not acceleration kek)
   - apparently aristotle didnt have an atwood machine
   - Issues In copernican system bc aristotle thought planets massless
 - Galileo contributions 
   - Demonstrated object acc under force 
   - Principle of inertia(uniform motion as natural as rest is, task is to explain changes in motion)
   - Italy econ depression prevents significant science, move up north 

#### Overall fx  
 - Largely accepted by 1630s-40s along with kepler 
 - Nobody had tied together work of copernicus galileo and kepler 

### Newton 
 - England, attended cambridge, Burst of creativity in cabin in woods bc plague(1666)
   - Calculus, started thinking about light and universal gravitation
 - Second creativity 1684-1686 wrote *Principa* 
 - Nervous breakdown 1693, job at the royal mind thru death 
 - President of royal society 1703, knighted 1705 
#### Newton and the occult(magic, i think)
 - Many manuscripts on alchemy 
 - alchemy a big part of his life until his mint days 
 - He seemingly chose to repress this part of him to better rep western science(suggesting some knowledge of absurdity of magic?)
#### Universal Law of Gravitation 
 - In *Principa*, last influential eng. book written in latin, defined laws of motion 
   - Obj@rest//F=ma//equal op react 
   - Applied to planetary bodies 
   - Did G/r^2 =F thing too 
 - One law demonstrated all motion in universe 
   - New cosmology world largely mechanical 

#### General newton stuff 
 - Believed god was everywhere present, caused mechanical things he observed 
 -  Newton had a world-machine idea that operated all of his forces and etc, widely accepted until einstein 
 - Lotsa ressitance to newtons ideas outside of england 

## Medicine 
 - Greek aristotle equivalent for medicine was galen(100s CE)
 - Dissected animals not humans 
 - Physiology dominated by galen 
 - 2 separate blood systems(1 muscular+red blood, other for digestion+dark red blood)
 - 4 bodily humors(blood(warm||moist), Yellow bile(Warm and dry), Phlegm(cold and moist), Black bile(cold and dry))
 - Disease resulf of inbalance of humors 
   - Docctors observe pee
   - Do bloodletting 
   - Some herbal medicines actually work 
 - Main ppl are paracelsus, Vesalius, Harvey
### Paracelsus 
 - Renamed himself paracelsus bc means >>>celsus, celsus was aincent physician 
 - High appointments but lost them quickly bc short temper, didnt like those who disagree with him 
 - Rejected aristotole and galen, attacked universities for contributing to continued teaching of them 
 - hoped to repl w/ new ideas based on new observations 
 - Proponenet of microcausm/macrocausm analogy(human is small replica of larger world)
 - Believed disease caused by chemical inbalance because chemical reactions of the universe were represented within ppl 
 - Focused on specific ratios of things in his treatments 
 - Switched contraries cure for like cures like(vaccines in future)
   - used toxins to cure patients affected by toxins 

### Vesalius 
 - Studied anatomy
 - influenced by one of galens texts talking abt practical research 
 - Wrote in depth dissection guide to humans, art and printing made possible by renaissance 
 - Corrected some of galens worst errors
 - Clung to some others like blood 2 types, etc 

### Harvey 
 - *On the motion of the heart and Blood* 
 - At the time, no major diff had emerged from galen abt blood 
 - He said
   - Same blood in veins and arteries 
   - Veins come from heart 
   - Blood makes a complete circuit 
   - Used ppl w/ mental health issues or on death row as subjects 
   - Didn't have widespread recognition until 1660s when capilarries were discovered 
 - Foundational for modern physiology 

### Chemistry 
 - Boyle(boyles law)
   - Gases, belief in atoms 
 - Lavoisier 
   - Element naming system, fundamentals of combination
   - Wife Marie-Anne was collaborator

## Women in the Origins of Modern Science 
 - Still scoial repression 
 - Some opportunities for elite women in humanism 
 - Women in science had to get informal education
 - Door open if could participate in works of brothers or father 
 - In germany, women could come from craft production as observational scientists(entomolgy and astronomy)(1/7 german astronomers female)

### Margaret Cavendish 
 - Aristocrat 
 - Participant in crucial debates 
 - excluded from royal society 
 - Talked abt defects of rational/empiricism 
 - Critical of idea that humans could master nature thru science 

### Maria Merian 
 - Craft tradition 
 - Entomologist
 - Learned illustration from father, used for insects etc 
 - Drew plant samples from south america 

### Maria Winkelmann 
 - Educated by father and ubcle
 - Married, was assistant to foremost german astronomer, discovered comet 
 - Praised by Leibniz(calc)
 - Limited in opportunity after husband died, but still found work 

### Debates on the Nature of Women 
 - Male opinions same as in mideavel 
   - Women weak, men are needed to control them 
   - Learned women seen as having overcome female liabilities 
 -  Little need for male authority 
 -  Women joined debate by arguing for women 
 -  Science used to keep women down(men larger skull, women larger pelvic area)
 -  Vesalius saw no difference in internals of men vs women 
 -  Professionalization makes midwifes men 

## Toward a New Earth: Descartes, rationalism, and a new view of humankind 
 - Descartes reflected dobut and uncertianty pervasive in the 17th C 
 - Raised jesuit, went to army but just wanted to think, Decided wanted to explore basis of math/reason, discourse on method, i think therefore(duality of mind and matter(cartesian dualism)), 
   - God as the great geometrician created all this 
   - Identity equated with mind and reason rather than body 
 - Father of modern rationalism 
 - Books forbidden y catholics and many protestants(split btw mind and body bad for jesuslovers)

## The Scientific Method and the Spread of Scientific knowledge
 - 17thC learning inc dramatically w/ universities becoming interested in science and royal and princely patronage 

### The scientific method 
 - how science is used to view the world 
#### Francis bacon 
 - Few scientific credentials
 - Rejected copernicus and kepler and misunderstood galileo 
 - Writing *the great instauration* called for new perception of everything with new method of perceving 
 - Argued for induction Particular->General 
 - Focus on practical results, using science to conquer nature(Cavendish anti)

#### Descartes 
 - you know, opp bacon 
 - Decuction, mathematical order, compliments bacon more than opp 
 - Newton used both backn empericism and descartes rationalism 
 - Sci mthd. didnt answer why something happens/meaning behind it, allowing continuation of religion 

### The Spread of Sci. knowledge
 - New societies and journals etc to communicate ideas between scientists and to the public 

#### The Scientific Societies 
 - English royal society evolves from oxford+london scientist gatherings, gets offical charter from king charles II in 1642
   - Little state support, simply coopted new members
 - French royal academy of sciences came from informal meetings, recognized in 1666 
   - Lotsa state support, under heavy control(KingLouisXIVabs)
   - state paid salary of members 
 - Both societies learn value of research early on 
   - Royal society investigates tech improvements 
   - French academy collected tools and machines 
 - Both return focus to theoretical math and astr. 

#### Scientific Journals 
 - French journal des savants 
   - Prints expirement results and general knowledge 
   - Appeals both to scientists and public  
 - English Philisophical transactions
   - was just papers, aimed at scientists 
   - Prototype for future scholarly journals 
  
### Science and Society 
 - Literate class incentivized to learn science to increase profit 
 - Early scientists demonstrate specifica ppeals of science to rich ppl 
 - Puritan reformers in the english civil war use science to try to reform when they r in power 
   - Levellers and diggers and ranters also propose adoption of new science ideas using paracelsus and hermeticism 
   - Rich respond by supporting mechanistic science 
   - Royal society was encouraged by ^^, part of reason for early focus on practical things 

### Science and religion 
 - Galileo demonstrates science and religion conflict 
 - Galileo didnt eel nessecary, religion separate from nature 
   - Church disagreed as aristotle view fell so well for them 
 - Educated people take dichotomy approach 
 - Increased secularism; chruch fails 
 - Spinoza and pascal show responses to cosmological revolution 

#### Spinoza - Explain???
 - Grew up in tolerant amsterdam, excommunicated from amsterdam synagogue bc rejected judaism 
 - Lived a quiet independent life, turned down university offers to preserve freedom of thought 
 - Unwilling to accept implications of descartes as god separate from wold of matter 
   - Believed god was everything; pantheism, separation of mind and matter not accounting for soul 
   - If you are separating the parts, Physical world has god but not rational world 
   - Undermines how god exists in nature 
 - Said god did creation, nature behaves badly as a response to man behaving badly
 - Analyzed human emotions
 - Thought everytihing had a human-findable rational explaination

#### Pascal 
 - Sought to keep religion and science together 
 - Accomplished math and science 
 - After vision in 1654, devoted life to religion
 - Tried to convert rationalists to christianity appealing to both reasoning and emotions(pascals wager or smth)
   - Humans frail but can be mislead by senses 
   - Determined to show christian religion NOT contrary to religion 
 - Thought man was lost to infinite world 
 - No evidence of losing chruch followers yet but mood was there
