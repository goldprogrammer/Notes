 - Britan(whigs/progressives vs tories/conservatives), later is radical labor party 
   - Whigs are the middle class industrializaiton party or landed gentry who benefit from whig policies for some reason 
   - 1688-hanovarian monarchs increase power of house of commons, need house of commons to appoint ministers to do things(montesquieu separation of things)(house of lords loses most of power)

     - Marx's industrial bourgeosie(political and econ liberalism)
     - Want social+econ reforms but not to help industrial workers 
   - both sides seek to expand voting rights to help in parliment 
 - France == Revolution 
   - History of radicalism bc history of lack of representaiton, therefore societal conservatism 
   - 1789, 1830, 1848 Moderate->development->RADICAL->moderate(1848 febuary moderate, june days r radical, louis phillipe as more moderate, elected emperor)
   - Restoration of the bourbon monarchy - Louis 18 and charles X 
   - bicameral legislature
   - Chamers of deputies(commons) vs peers(lords)**WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT LEAD TO REVOLT**

   - More power with wealthy middle calss with slightly more voters than the restoration 
   - 1848 - revolution vs louis philippe and guizon working too closely together - lower classes wanting more change 
   - Combination of diff parts of revolution topples gov but cant develop new gov bc middle class still is thinking everything is fine 
   - vs econ liberalism//more radical, constituent assembly to create new constitution 
     - Universal male suffrage
     - Louis blanc and national workshops closed in june(june days revolts ensue)
   - Second republic:single assembly universal male suffrage and president//election of louis napoleon, then declares new empire(emperor napoleon III)
 - Comp/contrast btw fr+br 
   - France more involvement of the lower class, need to make more radical changes 
   - France more focused on ideaological things, focused on what the system(extent of deomcracy etc) should look like not details of system
   - Both move towards more republic(no king)
   - Both industrial/liberal middle class(in britan is industrial practical reasons, france is more ideaological reasons)
   - Louis phillipe is king, moderate, louis blanc is socalist/radical, louis napoleon is president/emperor
