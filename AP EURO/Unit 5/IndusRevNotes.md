## IndusRev in GB 
 - Starts in GB ~1750, 1850 GB most powerful, 1900, US+Germ pass britain

### Origins(why GB)
 - Agricultural revolution inc food production, lower prices enable purchase of manufactured goods
 - Inc population bc ^ and cottage industry provide workers
 - Supply of capital
   - Well developed paper currency use 
   - Profits from cottage industry + trade
   - Rich ppl shifting from merchantry or cottage textile industry
 - Entrepreneurs(spirit)
   - GB society especially likes econ progress
   - Much risk of failure, ruthless decision-making

   - Best markets non-european - less luxury-wanting
   - Domestic market w/ best standard of living of anywhere
   - Demand leads ppl to inc supply by industrializing 

### Tech Changes and New Forms of Industrial Organization 
 - Cotton Industry 
   - GB already Leading textiles w/ cottage industry
   - Flying shuttle inc cloth, need more yarn -> Spinning Jenny, Water frame, 'mule' inc yarn->power loom
   - Entrepreneurs use ^ inventions to organize ppl in factories near rivers 
   - ^ Organization of ppl near rivers pops up towns 
 - Steam Engine 
   - Og for pumping water out of mines, adapted w/ shaft to turn wheels
   - Lets spread away from rivers, ensuring success of IndRev 
   - 1760 import 2.5mil lbs cotton, 1840 366mil lbs 
   - Factory system out-competes all workers everywhere
   - Powered by seemingly endless supply of coal 
 - The Iron Industry 
   - Linked to inc in coal mining 
   - New(way more efficient) methods of refining iron 
   - Used coke(pre-burned coal) to heat pig iron faster, made stronger 'wrought iron'
   - 1850s prod more iron than rest of world combined 
 - Transportation Revolution 
   - Need for more efficient ways to move goods, New roads and canals, invention of Railroads
   - Early rr in mines, 1804 first real rr, 1830 first public rr 
   - Faster(50mph) rr change perception of space - New sense of power w/ modifying nature, thru mountains, etc 
   - Side affects: jobs in upholstery, glass, etc etc, more joint stock compaines, inc in civil engineering abilty
   - Dec prices of goods, inc markets, inc factories, cyclic like many indrev things 
 - The Industrial factory 
   - Workers no longer own means of production 
   - New inc discipline need to keep expensive machines running 
   - New systems to have constant effort output(diff from agricultural growing season rush etc)
   - Adults disciplined by fines and firing(esp for drunkenness for obv reasons), Children by beating
   - Reflected in new churches - Methodism(must be disciplined, laziness sinful)
   - Resulting change in attitude, factory life became norm 

### Britain's great exhibition 1851
 - Held at crystal palace - entirely glass and iron
 - 6 mil ppl visit over 6 months - many domestic but many international 
 - Even trees inside palace - reflects human domination over nature 
 - Also demonstrate colonial power w/ culturally relevant things from india 
   - Criticized as inefficient compared to marvelous British system(lol)
 - "workshop, banker, trader of the world"

## The Spread of Industrialization 
 - Spread to americas + continent w/ diff speeds
 - Pre 1850 - USA, Germ, Fr

### Industrialization on the continent 
 - Low countries, Fr, Germ largely agrarian
 - Making similar advances w/ agritech, pop inc, inc trade 
 - Britain industrializes bc had good infrastructure, no tolls btw boundaries, fewer guilds, more spirit 
 - Borrowing Techniques and practices
   - Britain tries to prevent spread of inventions(dosent let artisans leave-1825)
   - Not very effective, ~2k tech ppl on continent, 1840 new generations spreading knowledge further
   - France and Germany est tech schools to train ppl 
 - Role of Government
   - Govs used to econ involvement
   - Aided tech education, grants to inventors and entrepreneurs, financed factories 
   - Infrastructure!!! - canals, rr
   - Also tariffs - Frederick list argues for them - free trade lets british goods run wild w/o competition 
 - Centers of industrialization
   - Cotton important but heavy industry more import 
   - Factories older mostly, belguim has a lot of coal, modernizes manufacturing with it(most industrialized on continent)
   - Factories more dispersed, cottage industry held on longer 
   - France does more luxury goods 
   - Until 1820s all machines came from britain
   - More focus on iron stuf w/ coke 

### The indRev in the US
 - 1800 US was very agrarian
 - Samuel slater first factory(waterpwr textile) in 1790 
 - 1813 power looms, then surpass britan w/ innovation(interchangeable musket parts), 'american system' reduces need for artisans 
 - Transportation - initially limited by large size, steamboat+rr+canals enable entire US as market for northeastern goods 
 - Labor Force - primarily moved from rural areas(rapid pop grow), some go west, many do factories esp women(Textiles), some seek to employ entire families 
 - Decline in rural births dec labor pool, more immigrants from euro 
 - Women, children, immigrants all unskilled, needs lotsa machine investment - faster mechanization than artisan-full britain
 - Northeast higher income, better quality of life, growing myth of social mobility(rich got richer, poor inc purchasing power)

### Limiting the Spread of Industrialization in the nonIndustrialized World
 - Russia remained rural and agricultural, remained serfs, not much middle class, tsars preferred stability of providing agricultural stuffs
 - The Example of India
   - Prevented from industrializing(BEIC controlled much), limited credit, raised transpo, land costs
   - Markets flooded with British goods, unable to be profitable

## Social Impact of the indRev
 - Much of europe stayed the same, but change obvious 

### Population Growth 
 - Inc in pop 18thc cont thru 19thc
 - Easier to track w/ census+gov bookkeeping
 - Birthrates dropping, deathrates inc w/ less war, famine
 - Industrialization didn't directly change population
 - Pop % in industry tasks inc 
 - 1850 Industry still small and decentralizes - islands in agricultural sea 
 - Overpopulation in countryside
 - **The Great Hunger**
   - Ireland mostly peasants working for selfish absentee british lords 
   - Potatoes ez to grow, half pop depends on them for survival 
   - 1845 potato blight, 1mil die of famine, 2mil emigrate to US+Br
 - **Emigration**
    - ~110k/yr immigrants esp from places w/ worst conditions
    - Spurred by bad conditions w/ poor harvests 
    - ~1mil left germany 
    - More often agricultural ppl move to cities to find work(urbanization)

### The Growth of Cities 
 - Euro not predominantly urban until 20thC
 - Cities chg from just for gov+merchants to factories too 
 - Britain expand in numbers of cities and ppl in each city - became food importer(not exp) bc agri decline 
 - Continental urbanization happened just less extreme(linked to urbanization)
 - **Living conditions in early indrev**
   - Miserable working conditions continuity, just more exadgerated w/ more ppl 
   - Wealthy+midclass live in suburbs, as approach city center conditions get worse(Rowhouses)
   - Sanitary conditions bad(streets as sewers)
   - Soot blackened buildings 
   - Deaths outnumber births in cities 
   - Food often fake(lead instead of pepper), gov refused to intervene bc 'competition'(until 1875 food and drug act)
   - Social investigations in france, then in britain(poor law commission) - see physical and moral differences in city ppl vs midclass
 - **Urban Reformers**
   - Well-off see ^^ as danger to society - rebellion, etc 
   - Edwin Chadwick - law bkgd, joined poor law comissions, advocated for modern sanitary reforms - lead to Public health act & National board of health
   - Midclass afraid of cholera
   - ANY RELIGIOUS ANDYS HERE??? USUALLY THERE ARE 

### New Social Classes: The Industrial Middle Class(imc)
 - Bougie change from merch/gov/artisan/law/scholar to industrial entrepreneur/banker/teach/doc/shopkeepsish+craftspplish
 - **New Industrial Entrepreneurs**
   - Constructed factories, purchased machines, assessed markets - aimed solely to get money by growing biz
   - Hard jobs, many many functions(capital, markets, objectives, org factory/labor, train supervisors)
   - Reinvested profits, feared bankruptcy
   - When did go bankrupt, new ppl take place 
   - Diverse bkgnds- many successful merchants, some farmers(sheep w/ cotton), religious dissenters(use support of religious communities)
   - British aristocrats also became entrepreneurs(MS DALLOWAY SHII)
 - **Significance of Industrial Entrepreneurs**
   - 1850 traditional entrepreneurs decline for biz aristocracy(new generation inherit)
   - New role along traditional landed elites 

### New Social Classes: Workers in the Industrial Age 
 - Factory workers eventually form proletariat but thru 1850 not majority in cities 
 - Mostly artisans+crafts ppl, some in luxury biz earn more
   - Guilded workers w/ apprentices but guilds gradually losing power w/ industry 
   - Generally anti-industrialization bc it could repl 
 - **Working Conditions for Industrial Working Class(IWC)
   - Psychological affects of discipline(disc. earlier)
   - Worst conditions in cotton mills(hot, dirty)
   - Coal mines w/ ppl dig +horses pull, 3-4ft high tunnels, fumes, humidity 
   - Child labor important agriculturally but now more exploited, paid 1/6-1/3 man 
     - Pauper apprentices - Orphans in parishes rented out to factories 
     - Many became deformed from werid positions 
   - Parliment does change for children 1830s+40s for factories and mines(other small places not so much like pottery works)
   - Factory act 1833 dec child labor, repl by women(paid 1/2 man), excessive hrs outlawed in 1844(similar only in factories+mines)
   - Seems natural to continue full family involvement from factory system 
   - Still most women work was domestic or agriculture, mostly single women 
   - Poor pblm addressed w/ poor laws + workhouses 

### Efforts at Change: Workers 
 - Labor organizaitons to do change 
 - Combination acts 1799-1800 reaction to french radicalism outlaw workers associations 
 - Trade Unions still fine tho - skilled workers form them(cotton spinners, ironworkers, coal miners, shipwrights)
   - Preserve current workers position(gatekeep)
   - Gain Benefits from employers(gaslight)
 - **The Trade Union Movement**
   - Blatantly illegal strikes lead to repeal of combination acts + new legislation to oversee unions 
   - 1820s+30s focus on national unions(robert owen cooperative over competitive lifestyle)
     - Grand National Consolidated Trades Union seeks 8hr work day - lacked real workclass support, collapsed, smaller unions reign 
   - Most successful small union - Amalgamated Society of Engineers(1850) unemployment benefits for small weekly payment 
 - **Luddites**
   - Skilled craftspeople attack machines threatening livelihoods(futile, lol)
   - Show intense passion vs industrialization - never caught, have lotsa local support 
 - **Chartism**
   - First important working class polit mvmnt 
   - Peoples Charter - Created 1838 by working mens assoc - Universal male suffrage, payment for parlippl, elim of prop qualifications for MPs
   - Female support 
   - 2 petitions w/ milions of signatures presented to parliment 1839+1842, seeking peaceful change 
   - Underlying threat of force "peacefully if we can, forcibly if we must"
   - Parliment didnt want democracy, rejected chartism, died by 1848 
   - Increased workingclass consciousness, gave sense of proletariat unity 

### Efforts at Change: Reformers and Government
 - Ppl like wordsworth see indrev as destruction of natural world
 - Reform ppl campaign vs abuses of factories, esp for children 
 - **Government Action** - dealing w/ poor ppl 
   - Factory acts 1802-1819 limiting child labor to 12hrs/day, <9yrs forbidden to work, children to recieve education during work(ONLY IN COTTON MILLS, NO ENFORCEMENT)
   - Factory act 1833 further strengthened w/ 9-13 8hrs, 13-18 12hrs, factory inspectors able to fine 
   - also 1833 2 hrs of education required in a working day 
   - 1847 13-18+women dec to 10hrs
   - 1842 coal mines act elim boys<10+women in mines
