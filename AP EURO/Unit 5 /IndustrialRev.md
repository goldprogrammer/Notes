# Post-napoleon world 
## Conservative reaction to FrRev 
 - Br, Russia, Prussia, Austria win leipzig defeating napoleon, 
 - Wars spread enlightenment ideas - soldiers like french changes 
 - Napoleon escapes back to france, raises new army, louis flees to belguim, defeated in waterloo(100 days)
 - Big four+france = quintouple comes after this, remakes europe 
 - Euro 1789 HRE still a big mess, Poland still exists 
 - 1801 right before napoleon, less poland 
 - After napoleon way more unified, no more HRE(confederation of the rhine), dutchy of warsaw(new poland)
 - 1810 france has everything either directly or indirectly
 - Post napoleon defeat, very chaotic again but less than before(german confederation w/ 39 states), established by congress of vienna 

### Congress of vienna 
 - Concert of europe - system made by 5 major powers, restore lotsa old monarchies and borders
 - Want balance of power, Legitimate governments(not enlightenment), Principle of intervention 
 - Dominated by klemens von Metternich+the german confederation(austrian)
 - Independent foreing policies(vienna)->balance of power(limiting france expansion etc etc)->Napoleonic wars->enlightenment ideas(metternech dosent like)->working together as european countries 
 - Principle of intervention 
   - Dont intervene in greece - politics based on reality, okay with revolution anti-ottomans(esp austria+russia)
 - Revolutions of 1848 not successful outside of france
 - Diff levels of conservatism
   - ENgland is less than metternech who is most 
   - England believes in rep body
   - Metternich says nope nope nope(even divine right monarchy)
   - America is quite liberal bc no monarchs 

### Conservatism 
 - Burke vs Metchze 
   - Burke(english)
     - Believes in civil rights of englishmen 
     - Gradual change(english system)
     - Not belive in natural rights - origin of rights is diff 
       - Locke more than rousseau
       - Glorious rev. not frRev 
     - Whigs(english liberals)
       - NOT complete universal suffrage 
       - 
   - Metchze 
     - More like metternech 
     - Belief that religion should be dominant force 
     - See enlgihtenment as force of disruption 

### The Latin American Revolutons 
 - Mexican revolution of 1810 succeed in driving out spainish(more lower class support than in rest)
 - Reasons
   - Creoles(spainish born in america(not peninsulares)) accept and promot enlightnment ideals seek to drive out spainish
   - Aided by napoleonic wars(inspired by frRev, but napoleonic wars destabilize portugal and spain)
     - Maybe inspired by napoleon and liberation ideas 
     - Fighting against conservative restoration of authority 
     - Lose autonomy when old monarchs come back 
   - British supports them, merchants who want revolution to happen bc easier trade(mercantalism bad)
   - Munroe doctorine supports, est gran columbia 
   - Emergence of inc in nationalism w/ britian noncooepration
   - Can be viewed as est balance of power in latin america 
 - Tupac Amarau revolt to establish amerindians not successful 
 - Simon Bolivar and Jose de San Martin: wins at Chacabuco and Ayachucho
