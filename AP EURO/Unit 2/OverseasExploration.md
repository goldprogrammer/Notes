Oct 07 2021
***
 - States support exploration 
    - Portugal, henry the navigator directly supports/controls explorers like vasco degama
      - Desire to seek allies against moorish(muslim kingdoms), traveled to africa, found kingdoms, traded
      - Continuation of crusades ish, reconquistaish
    - Columbus "Eriwok indians", thought he got to indonesia
    - Diaz Delcastillo - asztecs i think 
      - Difference in portugese vs spainish colonies
        - Spainish colonies on islands haiti(hispaniola) and cuba and viceroyalty of peru and mexico
        - Main trading post in asia is manilla 
        - Aztecs had slaves from neighboring areas(not racial-based)
        - Anger against aztecs is exploited by non azetc groups in mexico to support spainish 
        - Encomnienda+Mita(taxes in form of labor) system
          - Replication of Feudalism
          - Importation of africans is nessecary bc of labor shortage bc natives die 
      - Incas have internal struggle that helps pizarro(struggle for emperor) rather than aztecs conflicts with neighbors help spainish and cortez 
      - Portugal is the opposite, have one main area in americas(brazil, hard to move inland bc amazon rainforest), dont have enough population to push inland
        - Focus on asia(indonesia, china, japan, india, coasts of africa, control malacca)
        - Focus on trade rather than colonization
        - Lose this goal to dutch, english, french
    - Italy had all the resoures(banks, etc) to explore but didnt do explore bc not one unified state 
      - Already trading with ottomans 
    - England(wars, after civil war boom(1600s settlements but nothing major until even later)) and FR(wars, gets into it 1600s bc absolute monarchy) and Netherlands got into it late and germany and italy never did bc werent unified
    - Unified germany later on has lots of ppl, able to use that for their colonial things 
    - Spain and portugal are more unified, strong central gov bv religious uniformity/reconquista, etc 
    - READ FUGHER DOC(banks i think)
      - Exploration+conquest linked to simultaneous commercial expansion
      - Rise of international financial houses like house of fugger 
      - Orign in AUgsburggermany, spread throughout europe, influenced to political developments as well
      - Bought the election of charles V to HRE power(OG monetary corruption lol?)
      - Still acts deferent to idea of ruler, not to ruler person
      - Basically a threat lol
      - Expansion of monarchical/state power is driven by financial institutions, which are *actually* controlling the state power, reasons for exploration was state governments, most sailors were italian but being financed by other states bc italy dosent have resources for that 
 - [ ] **READ ANY SECONDARY SOURCE**
 - New concept of companies, banks, credit 
 - Dutch create first Joint stock company

## Effects on indeginious populations

 - Portugese have less emphasis on direct colonial administration than spainish, who do more direct control(plantations mines etc)
 - Some portugest try to convert(alfonzo de albequrque), trying to get back at muslims, not nessecarily as national policy, some missionaries undermine their trade :(, reason are expelled from japan 
 - Land ownership
   - Native american nature and gods linked, nature should be treated as gift/ with care

   - Dosent stay completely in econ, or using to stabilize spain or religious wars
   - Some wealth ends up in netherlands 
   - Price revolution(is there inflation)
     - Is caused by commercalization or by influx of silver 
     - Increase in population, need for more agricultural products
 - Trade in asia, Portugese -> dutch -> english -> french

 - Differences in goals between portugese and spain 
   - Portugese - Brazil, Sugar islands
   - China limits both to trading from just canton/guangzhou, have european buildings there, must stay there 
   - harder to do agriculture in both bc topography

## European plan 
 - Distinct economic trade plan
 - Want to get to asia to get trade goods(spices, silk, porcelain)
   - Italians get rich from giving a taste of asiatic goods 
   - Italians were trading with ottomanes, before and after fall of constantinople(which cut off trade more)
 - They want to go on these voyages(gold, glory, gospel)(trade, missionary work)
 - Linked to renaissance, wanna figure out if a theory is true, actually using education
 - ptolomy's map
 - desire to defeat ottoman turks, after constantinople falls, want to fight against turks/infidel 
 - hope to get around them and find christian kingdom in asia(myth of custer john/christian kingdom in asia)
 - Spainish fighting to get rid of muslims FROM SPAIN, pushing out muslims in asia too 
 - Spain approve columbus bc Desperate to beat portugese who just got around india 
 
 ## Gaining ability to expand 
  - maps, new knowledge(renaissance)
  - desire for knowledge 
  - Compass, ship construction 
  - Inspiration by marco polo 

 ## Mercantalism
  - State power involvement in economy/trade 
  - More exports than imports, colonies help not have to get stuff from others
  - Holding+having high supply of precious metals 
  - High level of protectionism of exports 
    - Tariffs

    - Triangle trade, government varied involvment in it 
  - State run banks(England+Amsterdam)
    - Credit+Loans+Bonds
  - Joint stock companies 
  - Finance exploration by 
    - Having money
    - Getting Loans(Pro: Keep returns, Con: can lose more $$)
    - Creating company(Pro: Spread risk, Con: Spread returns)
  - Overseas trade wealth builds up the systems, but also systems are needed 
  - Commercialism all over europe(commercial agriculture, irish famine caused bc agricultural products shipped out+potatoes are only food+blight destabilizes)
  - Traveling btw regions have tolls, guilds dominating production/set prices
  - Price revolution  
    - Mideavel is not free market, concept of fair profit determined by church 
    - Inflation going on, prices going up a little(influx of currency, commercial agriculture(selling excess food, drives up prices), increase in population)
    - Birth rate increases/death rate decreasing(lack of plagues, more access to foods)
    - Wages dnt keep up with prices, so urban and agrarian workers didnt benefit 

 ## Factors conditions motivations of exploration 
  - Economic motivations(know about the trade routes(trying to get to theindies ))
  - Comepteting against muslims
  - Tales of fantastic lands : 
    - *Travels of John Mandeville* and Prester John 
    - Marco polo - sees mongol china but europeans find chinese china
  - Trade goods coming in thru ottomans, who are threat to europeans, want to get around
  - Europeans want trade with china, not just to trade, chinese will not allow them to go to interior china 
  - Portugese make big profit from trading directly(either good relations or conquest)
    - Compete favorably with italians bc they get them thru ottomans(silk road->constantinople/malacca->india->persian gulf->ottomans/
    - helps undercut ottoman power, affects italians more tho
    - Prince henry the navigator, city of sagress
      - Creates school of navigation(renaissance edu/knowledge)
      - Diff maps and theories 
      - First thing they do is attack north africa, then move down coast and get islands
      - Realized they can go around africa
    - Spainish less directly involved than henry until they find the new world and they find the value 
    - Columbus says he can go faster than the portugese who are stopping everywhere and trading, fuled by competiiton with portugal success(Dias, pre degama) by degamas time they had treaty of tordesillas 
    - Spainish forst exploration with columbus
    - Americo vespuci discovers what is to the west of the treaty of tedorsillas(prev just thought it was right next to asia)
  - THEY HAVE A PLAN, HAVE PTOLEMYS MAP, maybe a bad map BUT THEY HAD A PLAN 
    - Prince henrys school of sagrass brings alll the existing knowledge to one place
    - Using compass and astrolabe, not a good timekeeper
    - Ships and Sailing - axial rudder, lateen sails, square rigs(sail against the wind), larger ships for more goods and cannons, knowledge of winds 
    - Reasons to go AND ability to go
