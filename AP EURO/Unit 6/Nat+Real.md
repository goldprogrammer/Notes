       - Weakening of austria by prussians allows venecia to end up with italy

     - Real politique: Would like unified germany but need military, diplomacy, war, power, etc, not austria 
       - Bismark appeals to the french - goes after french, goes around constitution then does plebicite to make it all ok later
       - First isolates austria, then fights, then agrees with austria to work with them vs french
       - State socialism - expansion of suffrage in germany - movement towards sociaism vs bismarkian conservatism
