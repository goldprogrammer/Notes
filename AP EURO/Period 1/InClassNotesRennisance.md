## Context(When does the rennisance begin - 1300s)
 - Can define as when writers started defining as rennisance(petrarch etc), not  everyone recognises this at the same time(some still have mideavel mentality)
   - Sometimes is diff by region, sometimes cy class, et    See through writings, artwork read/viewed y ppl, filters down(paint in chrches, etc everyone sees ) 
 - Begins in italy, spreads thru europe 
 - Different expression s of the rennisance everywhere(diff names, across times too(italian, northern, high rennaisance))
 - Main elements pre-rennisance(mideavel period/high middle ages)
   - Feudalism(Kings->vassals(Security, order)-> Peasants/serfs)
   - Feudalism not 100% feudalism, becomes more complex w/ villages, basic structure of land owners+serfs(in debt to landowners, cannot leave or be removed from land w/o permission of lord)/pesants
   - diffs
     - Might get warriors who dont have land
     - Might get landowners who arent warriors 
     - Might get free serfs/peasants (**Jacquerie** peasants revolt)
     - Mercenaries
   - Growth of towns(further alternatives to feudalism)

 - Rennisance comes up with middle ages term, btw antiquity+rennisance 
   - Aquinas would like chruch latin, Petrarch liked cicero latin
   - Reflects on existing in bad age, wanting to blame that on older age, which was only debatably bad
   - 12th + 13th C did study these things, but not for thenm as themselves, just used to support church(aquinas did that)
