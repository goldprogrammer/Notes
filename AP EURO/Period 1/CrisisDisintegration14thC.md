## Black Death and Social Crisis 
### Famine and Population
 - **little ice age**
   - Shorter growing seasons, severe storms/constant rain 
   - **Great famine** 1315-17 in northern europe 
   - Famine killed ~10% population 
   - Population had reached peak after High Middle ages, couldnt be supported by existing tech, prodution
     - Almost all productiveish land was being farmed
 - **Urbanization #1**
   - PPl moving to cities, often found worse conditions
   - Avg acerage not enuf to support a family
 - These set up for high mortality of plague

### The Blach Death: From Asia to Europe 
 - Struck Asia, North Africa, Europe
   - Most common/important form was bubonic plauge, spread by rats infested with fleas 
   - Mongols enabled spread from southwestern china to all of eurasia
 - Disease deets
   - Symptoms: High fever, ahing joints, lymph node swelling, dark blotches by under-skin bleeding
   - Bubonic was least deadly form but still 50-60% died who got it 
   - Pneumonic plauge, bacteria spread to lungs, coughing, spread easily
 - Europe 
   - Caused econ, social, political, cultural upheval
   - Ppl horrified by not understanding it 
   - Timeline in Europe: ![Spread of Bubonic Plauge in europe](./Spread%20of%20bbPlague.png)
   - Italy hit esp hard bc was so critical to trade (50-60% die)
   - Farming villages ~30% die
   - Euro pop decline by 25-50% 1347-1351
   - Major outbreaks  in 1361-62, 69, recurrances every 5-6 or 10-12 yrs until end of 15thC
   - The rich left cities, the poor lost restraint
   - Explainations 
     - God punishment(flagellants self-punish to cleanse selves of sin, gain gods favor)
       - Groups of flagellants grow, attack jews and oppositional clergy
       - Catholic church(pope) condemed flagellatts in 1349, by 1350 most flagellant movements destroyed
     - Anti-semitisim grows(Accused of causing plauge by poisioning wells)
       - Persecuted in spain
       - Worst was in pogroms(organized massacares) in germany
       - Many jews move to russia + poland(king offered protection), eastern europe home to large jewish communities
 - Survivors of plauge treat life as transient
   - Post-plauge european obsession with death, in sermons, tombstones
   - Art effects
     - Survivors often guilty abt surviving, more concerned abt gaining salvation
     - Art concentrates on pain and death
 - Econ Dislocation+Social upheval
   - 1000-1300, three classes Clergy(praying), Nobility(fighting), laborers(working)
   - Series of revolts end this
   - Plague causes labor shortage
   - Less demand for produce
   - Landlords suffering here
     - Aristocrats tried to limit wages, parliment **Statute of Laborers** tried to reduce max wages to pre-plague levels
     - Didn't work fully, did help
   - Higher wages enable pesants to free from debt somewhat
   - Limits to pesant advancement from plague+lord efforts to keep down+taxes create revolts
   - Revolts in France
     - 1358 pesant revolt(**Jacquerie**) in northern France
     - Caused by above+fx of 100yrswar
     - Tactics used incl. mercs destroying pesant crops+living off their land
     - Aristocrats look upon pesants with contempt+vice versa
     - Castles burned +nobles murdered
     - Jacquerie ended bc nobles close ranks, massacre pesants, end revolt
   - English revolt
     - **English Pesants Revolt of 1381** most prominent revolt
     - Product of rising expectations, anger at advancement being limited by Aristocrats
     - Immediate cause was monarchy attempt to impose tax of each adult member of population
     - PPl revused to pay 
     - Initially revolt was successful, property burned, etc 
     - Marched on london, King Richard II(15yrsold) accepted terms if peasants would return home
     - King reneged, arrested hundreds of rebels
     - Poll tax gone, most of rebels pardoned
   - Revolts in cities 
     - Commercial activity suffered from black death
     - Surplus of goods, drop in demand = decline in trade
     - midclass merchants and manufacturers try to restrict competition
     - In urban areas where pesants worked with low wages, revolts broke out 
       - Ghent(1381), Rouen(1382)
       - Revolt of the **Ciompi** in florence(Wool workers)
         - Angry bc real wages decline bc currency devalued
         - Won some concessions(guild, gov representation)
   - Overall
     - Revolts may have had temporary success, rarely real 
     - Ruling class usually united, quashed dissent
