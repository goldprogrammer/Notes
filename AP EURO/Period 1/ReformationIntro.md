     - King James bible
   - Artwork(Lucas Chronic woodcut artist)
   - Reform, economic, political, 
   - National identity(Spanish catholicism, English authority over church)
     - Theme of states creating gov over states 
     - Not one single leader of protestants bc ^^ like pope
     - German princes contrary to pope/church
   - Luther's ideas are about church doctorines(HIERARCHY)
     - Abuses(indulgences) are obvious
     - Then becomes more structural reform, attacks HIERARCHY
     - TETZLER(1ST DOC)
   - Luther is very familar with the bible 
     - Mideavel acedemic religious discussions
     - IS A THEOLOGIAN
     - Debates everything he thinks is done diff rom the bible(95 theses nailed to door on all saints day(ppl at church))
     - Contempoary w/ machievelli, etc 
   - Transubstantion = Sacrament is actually blood/body of christ, made so by priest
   - Consubstantiation = Sacrement is rememberance of christ 
   - Luther = Transubstantion but priest made
   - Luther doesnt like confesion
     - Okay with baptism+euchrist
   - Selling of indulgences(Confirmation from church/pope removing past+future sins)(crusades, then purchased for moneys)
   - Confession(confessing sins)+Penance(making up for sins) luther dosent like 
   - Commit a sin(nonmortal), Go to priest+confess, priest grants you absolution, Then give penance(what to do to make up for it(prayer, or good thing, maybe give church the money), also gets souls of ppl who are dead saved)
     - Church claims it can do this bc of excess good worth from other people, start selling these 
     - BUYING WAY INTO HEAVEN
     - Money is going to rome+granduer
     - Church says they are doing good with expanding rome+grandeur 
     - Church benefits from positive glorification of god
 - Luther peasants revolt 
   - Was against the peasants bc were disobedient to stat/civil authorities/rightful authorities
   - He dosent follow papal authorities bc he dosent think they should have authority 
   - Social and political conservaitsim(religious *superconservatism/modernism*)
 - Luther says all humans are bad/sinful(original sin), cannot gain justification by good works 
   - Good works as extension of faith, not part of process of salvation
   - FAITH can remove original sin 
   - **Good works do not justify you(not transactional), FAITH Justifies you, GOOD WORKS ARE EXPRESSION OF FAITH**
   - Lutheran traditions remove saints days, etc(christians go to church on sundays)
   - Protestant work ethic(Vaber), ppl are called to whatever will do in life("found your calling"), in trade+other econ activities can be called to that role, use wealth to be as good as they can, makes that okay 
     - Being the best at your job to glorify god, reinvest money 
     - "spirit of capitalism"
 - Theology(thomas aquinas is ex) <<< Scriptrure
   - Theology developes concepts from scripture
   - Protestants want this less 
   - What is included in bible(another debate)
   - Erasmus(not protestant) wants to read it in latin

## Needs to be desire for reform for reform to happen 
 - Contrasts wycliff and hus with luther
   - Pockets of reform but ideas dont spread
 - Influence of the renaissance(not idealogical influence, is education)
 - Humanist idea of improving your life
 - *REMEMBER THAT THE MIDDLE AGES WAS LIKE MASS BRAIN, DIDNT REALLY THINK FOR THEMSELVES*
 - Reactation against the renaisance popes being too worldly 
 - Lots of people say they dont want to be as focused on this world/this life 
 - PPL WANT TO BE GOOD christians
   - Northern renaissance is positive depiction of that 
 - Reformation was not in line with movement "forward" more return to conservatism 
 - Groups of involvement
   - Common ppl 
   - Middle class, money dosent want to leave area, want change 
   - Kinds and ruling princes 
 - Influence of christian humanism
   - Use of humanist ideals and techniques to christianity(holy scripture over theology)
   - Look to early sources and early church as knowledge 
   - Erasmus and Tomore in praise of folly and utopia both make fun of europe
     - Tomore might not have believed what he wrote in utopia, uses to criticize own time period 
     - WANT REFORM, SUPPORT CATHOLIC CHURCH 

## Conflicts and calls for reform 
 - Corruption of the curch and focus on worldly matters and wealth(Leo X, Julius II, etc)
 - Fight against italian states, resist HRE, etc etc 
 - Pluralism, multiple church offices held by one offical
   - Get more wealth and power
   - Not present in one or the other 
   - Buying or selling of offices, noblepeople want affiliation with church 
 - Mysticism with relics+indulgences(the modern devotion - Thomas a kempis)*the imitation of Christ* desire for certianty

## Calvin
 - Everything is perdetermined
 - Based on early view of christian god(god is all-knowing, god already knows)(since you dont know you should ask like you are)
 - Nuance is you don't know the nature of god/dosent know if are elect(three tests)
   - Profession of faith
   - Godly life(Good works, like luther removes good works directly from salvation)
   - Sacrements of baptisim and communion
 - Undercuts role of preists
 - Less individual, more focus on god
 - Calvinist community has a lot of control over what could lead to sin(remove sinful conditions(taverns, theatres, gambling, alcohol))

## Radical reformers 
 - State control of religion is flawed
 - Look back to original community christianity
 - Luther believes in civil authority bc bible and practicality 
 - Radical reformers = Anabaptists(dont believe in children being baptised/adults baptized)
   - Equality of all believers
   - All are equal before god as followers of god 
   - Complete seperation of church and state
 - Ideas fuel peasant revolts(successful for a yearish)
   - Have 12 points for their feudal leaders
   - REvolution of 1525/German peasants revolt 
   - Is controlled and put down
 - Millienalists(end times are coming)
 - Menenites(simple living, rejection of church control by papacy+state)

## Teresa of Avila(catholic/counterreformer)
 - Addresses god directly, reformation+violence caused by it is not worth the change 
 - Agrees with christian humanists(moore+erasmus)
 - Recovnises her role as christian and human, puts her faith in god 
 - Pushes back on idea that women cant be virtious/good christians 
 - Womens role is less prominent in protestant churches bc cant be nun, women pushed back into the home
 - Challenges both catholic and protestant churches

## Counter/Catholic Reformation 
 - Catholics call catholic, Protestants call Counter 
 - Early on, catholics sought to get rid of protestnatism
 - Wars in germany(main catholic ppl are HRE, Charles V king of spain+HRE, gets rich off of colonies so he can fight EVERYONE AT ONCE)
 - Once accept protestantism, try to fix increase by fixing issues in church 
   - Get Jesuits
   - Get Ppl who want stability
   - Get erasmus, thomas moore
 - Try to reassirt catholic things
   - Pope, Piety(wanting to be good christian), No reformation if they dont want to be good christians 
   - Not just individual view, is how they see the world 
   - Determines their salvation
   - Secularism of Rennisance is removal of religious influence over certian things, NOT AGNOSTICISM
   - Monk orders encourage revival of mysticism
     - Pilgramiges, iconagraphy, rituals 
     - More spiritual, less rational 
   - Most important is Jesuits founded by loyola
     - Directly respond to protestants with idea of personal attainment aiof grace by will power and good works
     - Knowledge of scripture, military structure, strong training 
     - Obedience to the order and pope 
     - Preaching/sermonizng, have to know bible and how to apply it 
   - Not able to kill movement bc cant get luther(german princes), cant hold back spread, king phillip of spain tries but no success outside of spain 
 - Papal reform initatied by paul III in 1530s+40s
   - Debate btw cardinals contarini and caraffa, attempt to reconcile
   - Conservatives rejected compromises
   - Lead to reestablisment of inquisiton and index of forbidden books, followed by council of trent; result of papal supremacy
 - If Catholic church had listened to luther, would there have been the reformation 
 - 

## Jesuits
 - A catholic order(of monks) of missionaries
 - Major monk orders 
   - Dominicans(education/knowledge, copy books, etc)(scholars)(critisized by owning a lot of land)
   - Augustineans(what luther was, st. augustene(around sack of rome) wrote city of god(focus on city of god/next lie rather than human city of rome), shows inspired by earlier order)
