   - Selling of indulgences(Confirmation from church/pope removing past+future sins)(crusades, then purchased for moneys)
   - Confession(confessing sins)+Penance(making up for sins) luther dosent like 
   - Commit a sin(nonmortal), Go to priest+confess, priest grants you absolution, Then give penance(what to do to make up for it(prayer, or good thing, maybe give church the money), also gets souls of ppl who are dead saved)

   - Get Jesuits
   - Get Ppl who want stability
   - Get erasmus, thomas moore
 - Try to reassirt catholic things
   - Pope, Piety(wanting to be good christian), No reformation if they dont want to be good christians 
   - Not just individual view, is how they see the world 
   - Determines their salvation
   - Secularism of Rennisance is removal of religious influence over certian things, NOT AGNOSTICISM
   - Monk orders encourage revival of mysticism
     - Pilgramiges, iconagraphy, rituals
