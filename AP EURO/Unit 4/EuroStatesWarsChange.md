# The European States 
 - Mostly monarchs, claims of divine right supplanted by secular utilitarian arguments reinforced by some philisophes 

## Enlightened Absolutism?
 - Philisophes want ideas of natural rights carried out by despots 
   - Want religious toleration, freedom of speech+press, right to hold private property for a despot to be 'enlightened'
   - Must progress towards enlighened society 
   - Must not be arbitrary rule, universality of laws+enforcement 
   - Held that despots were the best path forward bc distrusted the people
     - Frederick II Prussia, Catherine the great RU, Joseph II austria 
     - Questionable if they actually followed this advice 

## The Atlantic Seaboard states
 - As new econ center bc explore, within english and french and dutch expand as spain and portugal decline, then dutch decline 

### France: issues with the monarchy 
 - Monarchy not very influenced by Enlightenment
 - Louis XIV left france w/ lotsa territory, debt, a 5yrold successor 
   - Alchoholic and immoral behaviors of ruler(duke of orleans) limited good things
   - Cardinal Fleury after duke, France pulled back from foreign affairs, promoted industry 
   - After Fleury, Louis XV rules alone - lazy and weak, influenced by ministers and mistresses 
     - Ex Madame de Pompadour charmed LXV, made lotsa important decisions 
   - Louis recognizes issues comp. lost empire(7yrswar), big taxes, debt, starvation w/ friviolus life at versailles
 - Succeeded by Grandson LXVI who was not knowledgeable, wife was spoiled austrian which lead to revolution 

### Great Britian: King and Parliment 
 - Glorious Revolution prevented absolutiosm without fully initiating constitutional monarchy 
 - Power shared between king and parliment, parliment gradually grows in power  
 - King appointed ministers to make policy and guide parliment, parliment did the legislative things 
 - Parliment dominated by landed aristocracy
   - House of lords(peers, sat for life)
   - House of commons(landed gentry, justices of peace in counties)
   - Two groups highly similar
 - Technically elected but not popular elections
   - Support gained by patronage + bribes 
   - "Pocket Boroughs" controlled by single person 
   - Resulted in same families being elected over and over again 
 - Queen Anne(stuart) died without an heir, protestant rulers of german hanover got crown  
   - First +2nd hanoverian king(george I and II) didnt speak english, ministers guided parliment more directly, contrib to modern cabinet system 
 - Robert walpole as prime minister sought peaceful foreign policy to avoid land taxes 
 - Increasing middle class+ growing trade and industry inc support for Will. Pitt the elder, prime minister, got canada and india in 7yrswar 
 - ^ dismissed by George III, replaced by king's choice Lord Bute 
   - Loss of american colonies and discontent over electoral system -> criticism of king -> inc in parliment pwr  
   - George avoides disaster by appointing will pitt the younger, supported by all classes+king
