# Test notes
## Purpose
 - Hoping VSCode works for notes so I dont have to worry about joplin
 - Lets see if math works $y=mx+b$ 
 - How about more latex 
  $\sum_{i=0}^5$
 - Interesting, I think latex stuff can't have spaces if its in one line.  hummmm
 - Lets test tables
 - |-----|-----|-----|
 - eh they never worked anyway lol
 - checkboxes?
 - [ ] test yep, but not interactive...
 - what if we go in?

                       - f

 - **at least shift tab works and theres no limit**
